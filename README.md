# BuzzRoom 🙌

- BuzzRoom is an innovative social media platform designed to foster dynamic and meaningful conversations around trending topics. 
- Created as a part of my learning journey with web sockets, this project serves as a practical application of real-time communication technologies.
- Users can enter virtual rooms with their name and room ID to text each other, making it a perfect blend of social interaction and technology.

## About Web Sockets
- Web sockets are a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection. This allows for real-time interaction between users and the server.
- Unlike HTTP, which is a request-response protocol where the client requests data and the server sends a response, web sockets enable continuous communication without the need to establish a new connection for each message.
- This efficiency and capability for real-time updates make web sockets ideal for applications like BuzzRoom, where timely interaction is crucial.


## Tech Stack 🧑‍💻
- Frontend: React.js and Tailwind CSS
- Backend : Node.js, Express
- Other Tools: Socket.io, Web Sockets, React Router Dom

## Personal Reflections 😍😍
- Working on BuzzRoom has been an enlightening experience. Learning and implementing web sockets allowed me to explore the vast potential of real-time web applications. 
- With the knowledge and skills gained from developing BuzzRoom, I am excited to start building a bigger website using web sockets.
- This upcoming project will aim to expand on the concepts of real-time interaction, incorporating more advanced features and a broader scope to create a comprehensive and engaging platform for users.
